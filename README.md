# 🧪 Yusuf Winston — Software QA Engineer

Hi! I’m Yusuf — a detail-oriented QA Engineer with a strong foundation in testing Web and Mobile applications.  

Before transitioning into tech, I managed a fast-paced barbershop for 7+ years.  
That experience sharpened my **attention to detail**, **communication**, and **customer-first mindset** — all traits that now help me ensure software quality and excellent user experiences.

I’m currently focused on:
✅ Manual QA  
✅ Functional + UI testing  
✅ Mobile testing (iOS)  
✅ Clear documentation and bug reporting  
✅ Growing into automation
